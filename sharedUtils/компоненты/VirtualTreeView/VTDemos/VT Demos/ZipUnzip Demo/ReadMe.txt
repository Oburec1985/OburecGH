This source is intended to be a demonstration of use of 2 components:

Since the latest is always available at the authors' sites, I have not
included any source code for the components themselves. If you wish
to compile this code, I advise you to check with the sites listed
and download the relevant code. 

Here are the components --Alphabetically listed by VCL name.

DelphiZip v1.6 (or above?)
  http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Orchard/8607/
  http://members.tripod.lycos.nl/Vleghert/
  Chris Vleghert
  cvleghrt@worldonline.nl
  
  BTW, I have included the DLLs that are necessary to
  run this demo. Please either put them in the same
  directory as the ZipDemo1.exe or in the <windows>\System32
  directory.


ImagelistEx (System ImageList; TImageList derivative)
  Werner Lehmann <wl@bwl.uni-kiel.de>
  No web site given. As a result, I have included it in 
  this zip file (i.e. ImagelistEx.pas)

VirtualTreeView v2.3 (or above?)

I have modified the Demo1 in DelphiZip to use VirtualTreeView,
and added a few frills. The paragraph below is from DelphiZip:

   This is a very complete File Manager type of program that 
   lets you create archives, view archives, extract files, etc.  
   It can also turn .zip files into .exe files (and vice-versa). 
   This program does NOT let you create .EXE files directly; 
   see the documentation for DelphiZip.

While I believe it works, you are strongly advised to test it 
for yourself. In other words, usual disclaimers apply.
